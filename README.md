# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis
AutosRUs' MechaCar prototype is experiencing production issues that managment feels can somehow be solved by linear regression models unrelated to the manufacturing process.  An analysis of MPG and PSI of suspension coils from manufacturing lots is requested.  T-tests will be run to determine statistical variance of manufacturing lots from the mean population.  Subsequently, a statistical study is requested to compare vehicle performance of the MechaCar against vehicles of other manufacturers.
